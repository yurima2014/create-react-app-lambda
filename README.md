## Create-React-App-Lambda

This project is a simple quiz game.
The user is asked a series of multiple choice questions.
Each question scores points if answered correctly.
Questions have different difficulty:
'easy' - 1 point
'medium' - 2 points
'hard' - 3 points

Each question has to be answered in a limited time (15 seconds),
otherwise no points will be scored on the question.

When the user completes the quiz, he is presented with his results,
including: the number of points scored / total and the number of questions answered correctly / total.
